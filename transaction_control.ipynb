    "In Psycopg transactions are handled by the connection class. By default, the first time a command is sent to the database (using one of the cursors created by the connection), a new transaction is created. The following database commands will be executed in the context of the same transaction – not only the commands issued by the first cursor, but the ones issued by all the cursors created by the same connection. Should any command fail, the transaction will be aborted and no further command will be executed until a call to the rollback() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection is responsible for terminating its transaction, calling either the commit() or rollback() method. Committed changes are immediately made persistent in the database. If the connection is closed (using the close() method) or destroyed (using del or by letting it fall out of scope) while a transaction is in progress, the server will discard the transaction. However doing so is not advisable: middleware such as PgBouncer may see the connection closed uncleanly and dispose of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to set the connection in autocommit mode: this way all the commands executed will be immediately committed and no rollback is possible. A few commands (e.g. CREATE DATABASE, VACUUM, CALL on stored procedures using transaction control…) require to be run outside any transaction: in order to be able to run these commands from Psycopg, the connection must be in autocommit mode: you can use the autocommit property."

    "Warning By default, any query execution, including a simple SELECT will start a transaction: for long-running programs, if no further action is taken, the session will remain “idle in transaction”, an undesirable condition for several reasons (locks are held by the session, tables bloat…). For long lived scripts, either ensure to terminate a transaction as soon as possible or use an autocommit connection."
