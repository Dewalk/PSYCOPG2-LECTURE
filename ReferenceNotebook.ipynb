    "Best practices When should I save and re-use a cursor as opposed to creating a new one as needed? Cursors are lightweight objects and creating lots of them should not pose any kind of problem. But note that cursors used to fetch result sets will cache the data and use memory in proportion to the result set size. Our suggestion is to almost always create a new cursor and dispose old ones as soon as the data is not required anymore (call close() on them.) The only exception are tight loops where one usually use the same cursor for a whole bunch of INSERTs or UPDATEs. When should I save and re-use a connection as opposed to creating a new one as needed? Creating a connection can be slow (think of SSL over TCP) so the best practice is to create a single connection and keep it open as long as required. It is also good practice to rollback or commit frequently (even after a single SELECT statement) to make sure the backend is never left “idle in transaction”. See also psycopg2.pool for lightweight connection pooling."
